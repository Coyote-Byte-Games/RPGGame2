    1) Start by using MonoBehaviours. Image ScriptableObjects only as data. Do not imagine ScriptableObjcts to have instance ethods, they are all static, and thus irresponsible for OOP.
    2) Do not be afraid of creating new .cs files. Game development, especially in Unity, is too complex for a few classes to suffice.
